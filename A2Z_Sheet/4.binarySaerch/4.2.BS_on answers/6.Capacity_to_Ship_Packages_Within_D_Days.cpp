// Problem Statement: You are the owner of a Shipment company. You use conveyor belts to ship packages from one port to another. The packages must be shipped within 'd' days. The weights of the packages are given in an array 'of weights'. The packages are loaded on the conveyor belts every day in the same order as they appear in the array. The loaded weights must not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the ship. Find out the least-weight capacity so that you can ship all the packages within 'd' days .

// Brute Force Approach
// TC: O()
// SC: O()
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check how many days needed for given capacity
    int daysNeeded(vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
        // Initialize day count to 1
        int days = 1;
        // Current load for the day
        int currentLoad = 0;

        // Iterate over all package weights
        for (int w : weights) {

                days++;
                currentLoad = w;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, add weight to current load
                currentLoad += w;
            }
        }
        // Return total days needed
        return days;
    }

    // Function to find minimum ship capacity to ship in d days
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int d) {
        // Find maximum weight as minimum capacity
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        // Find total sum as maximum capacity
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

        // Iterate from minimum to maximum capacity
        for (int capacity = left; capacity <= right; capacity++) {
            // Calculate days needed for current capacity
            int needed = daysNeeded(weights, capacity);
            // If days needed are less than or equal to d, return capacity
